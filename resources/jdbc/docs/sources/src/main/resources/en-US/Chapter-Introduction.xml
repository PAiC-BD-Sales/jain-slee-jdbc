	<title>Introduction to &THIS.PLATFORM; JAIN SLEE &THIS.RA; Resource Adaptor</title>

	<para>The &THIS.RA; Resource Adaptor adapts JDBC Datasources to JAIN SLEE domain, providing means to execute JDBC statements in asynchronous fashion. JDCB statements are executed in the RA runtime resources, freeing the JAIN SLEE Event Router from the burden of having its executors (threads) resources blocked by interactions with JDBC Datasources, and results are provided to applications through JAIN SLEE events. The JAIN SLEE application is also completely free from having to manage connection closings.</para>
