# Extended JAIN SLEE JDBC

> Extended JAIN SLEE JDBC is an enhanced version derived from RestComm JAIN SLEE available at https://github.com/RestComm/jain-slee.jdbc. This iteration introduces a series of improvements to augment its capabilities.

## Key Features
* Empowers applications to establish communication with legacy JDBC-based systems.
* Facilitates asynchronous execution of JDBC statements, optimizing resource utilization within the RA runtime.
* Relieves the JAIN SLEE Event Router from resource-blocking interactions with JDBC Datasources.
* Seamlessly delivers results to applications through JAIN SLEE events.
* Eliminates the need for JAIN SLEE applications to manage connection closures, streamlining development and operational processes.
