# Extended JAIN SLEE JDBC


The Extended jain slee JDBC is cloned from RestComm JAIN SLEE(https://github.com/RestComm/jain-slee.jdbc)
from which they have added a set of improvements and new.

# Introduction

Open Source Extended Jain slee JDBC allows applications to communicate with legacy jdbc communications, providing means to execute JDBC statements in asynchronous fashion. JDCB statements are executed in the RA runtime resources, freeing the JAIN SLEE Event Router from the burden of having its executors (threads) resources blocked by interactions with JDBC Datasources, and results are provided to applications through JAIN SLEE events. The JAIN SLEE application is also completely free from having to manage connection closings.

# Build Extended JAIN SLEE JDBC

Ensure that the following requirements have been met before continuing with the install.  The hardware requirements don't differ from the underlying JAIN SLEE requirements, refer to its documentation for further information.  The JAIN SLEE JDBC requires JAIN SLEE properly set.
